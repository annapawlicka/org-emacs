This extension provides several commands that are useful for c++-mode:

* `fa-show' -- show an overlay hint with current function arguments.
* `fa-jump' -- jump to definition of current element of `fa-show'.
* `moo-complete' -- a c++-specific version of `semantic-ia-complete-symbol'.
* `moo-propose-virtual' -- in class declaration, list all virtual
  methods that the current class can override.
* `moo-propose-override' -- similar to `moo-propose-virtual', but lists all
  inherited methods instead.
* `moo-jump-local' -- jump to a tag defined in current buffer.
